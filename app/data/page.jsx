      matchInfo: `Why Fukang matches you 
        Your match is Fukang — it means you are someone who values beauty, rarity, 
        depth, and elegance. You see beyond the surface. You blend logic with artistry.
        You shine quietly but powerfully, and people are drawn to your uniqueness. `,
      profile: `Name: Fukang Discovery / Found 
        Date: 2000 in China 
        Location: Near Fukang, Xinjiang Province, China 
        Observed Fall: No — it was not seen falling 
        Total Known Mass (Tkw): ~1,003 kg (main mass)`,
      classification: `Type / Class: Pallasite (specifically, Main Group Pallasite) 
        Structure / Texture: Olivine (gem-quality crystals) embedded in a nickel-iron metal 
        matrix. Regions contain “massive olivine clusters up to ~11 cm in diameter, 
        intersected by thin metal veins. 
        Composition details: • Fe ~89.9 wt%, Ni ~9.0 wt% 
        • Accessory elements: P = 0.62 wt%, Co = 0.51 wt%, trace As, Ga, Ge, Ir values. 
        • Oxygen isotopes: δ¹⁸O = 2.569 ‰, δ¹⁷O = 1.179 ‰, ∆¹⁷O = –0.157 ‰ `,
      significance: `When cut and polished, its olivine crystals look like  stained-glass: translucent 
        green, golden, shining through the metallic parts. 
        It is among the most beautiful meteorites known and extremely prized by collectors 
        and scientists alike. 
        Because pallasites come from the boundary between core and mantle of parent 
        asteroids, Fukang gives scientists a rare window into those deep interior regions. 
        In 2008, a large slice (~420 kg) was offered for auction, with a predicted value of 
        ~$2 million, though the lot didn’t sell whole. 
        A 31 kg type specimen is housed at the University of Arizona.`,

      profile: `Name: Seymchan
Discovery / Found Year: 1967
Location: Magadan Oblast, Russia
Observed Fall: No
Total Known Mass (Tkw): Several tons`,
      classification: `Type: Pallasite (stony-iron meteorite)
Group: Main Group Pallasite (PMG)
Structure: Coarse octahedrite with olivine crystals
Composition: Approximately 9.15% nickel, with trace elements including gallium,
germanium, and iridium`,
      significance: `Appearance: Exhibits a striking contrast between metallic iron-nickel matrix and translucent olivine crystals, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.
Structure: The Widmanstätten patterns, visible when etched, reveal the slow cooling process within the meteorite's parent body.
Scientific Importance: Seymchan's heterogeneous structure provides insights into the complex processes occurring in the early solar system.
Cultural Impact: Its unique beauty has made it a subject of interest for collectors and researchers alike.`,

      profile: `Name: Gibeon
Discovery / Found Year: Known since ancient times; scientifically studied since the 19th century
Location: Gibeon area, Namibia
Observed Fall: No
Total Known Mass (Tkw): Many tons of fragments (large iron meteorite fall)`,
      classification: `Type: Iron meteorite, fine to medium octahedrite
Structure: When etched, displays Widmanstätten patterns — distinctive interleaving 
bands of kamacite and taenite
Composition: Iron-nickel alloy with trace elements such as cobalt, phosphorus, 
gallium, germanium`,
      significance: `
The Widmanstätten patterns make it visually striking — like layers or filigree inside metal.
 Many museum specimens are displayed etched so the pattern is visible.
 It’s one of the more famous iron meteorites, often used in jewelry, artwork, and displays.
 Demonstrates slow cooling in its parent body core, giving insight into deep space metallurgy.`,
